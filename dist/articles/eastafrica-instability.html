        <div class="article-body">
          <p>East Africa has emerged as the new epicenter of youth-led unrest, surpassing the Sahel, which has traditionally been viewed as the most volatile region on the continent.</p>

          <p>A recent report highlights democratic backsliding, economic stagnation, and political repression as key drivers of instability across East African states.</p>

          <p>Young populations, frustrated by unemployment and inequality, are increasingly turning to protests as a means of expressing discontent.</p>

          <p>Analysts argue that the region’s demographic boom, while a potential asset, has become a liability due to poor governance and limited opportunities.</p>

          <p>Comparisons with the Sahel show that while extremist violence dominates headlines there, East Africa’s instability is more rooted in civic and political grievances.</p>

          <p>Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia have all witnessed waves of demonstrations in recent years, often met with heavy-handed responses from security forces.</p>

          <p>Observers warn that repression without reform risks deepening mistrust between governments and their citizens.</p>

          <p>Economic inequality remains stark, with urban youth feeling excluded from growth narratives that celebrate infrastructure but neglect job creation.</p>

          <p>Rural communities, meanwhile, face land disputes and resource scarcity, adding another layer of tension to the political landscape.</p>

          <p>International organizations stress the importance of inclusive governance, urging leaders to prioritize dialogue over confrontation.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to encourage reforms, but progress has been slow and uneven across the region.</p>

          <p>Regional bodies such as the African Union and IGAD are being called upon to play a stronger role in mediating disputes and promoting stability.</p>

          <p>Global powers, too, have vested interests, with instability in East Africa threatening trade routes and investment flows.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend targeted economic reforms, including youth-focused entrepreneurship programs and education initiatives.</p>

          <p>Without such measures, the risk of unrest spreading across borders remains high, potentially destabilizing neighboring states.</p>

          <p>International aid, while helpful, must be aligned with local realities to avoid fueling dependency or resentment.</p>

          <p>Grassroots movements are gaining traction, showing that young people are not only protesting but also organizing for change.</p>

          <p>The future of East Africa’s stability hinges on whether governments can harness this energy constructively rather than suppress it.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, the region stands at a crossroads: embrace reform and empowerment, or face escalating cycles of unrest that could define the next decade.</p>
