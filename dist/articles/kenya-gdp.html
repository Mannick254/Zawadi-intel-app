        <!-- Article Body -->
        <div class="article-body">
          <p>Kenya’s GDP has risen from Sh7 trillion in 2015 to over Sh11 trillion in 2025, reflecting resilience amid droughts, elections, and global shocks. The pandemic dip in 2020 was followed by a strong rebound in 2021, setting the stage for steady growth in the years that followed.</p>
        
          <p>Economists attribute this milestone to infrastructure investment, expansion of the digital economy, and strong performance in agriculture and services. Industrial parks and renewable energy projects have diversified the economy further.</p>
        
          <p>Major highways, railways, and port expansions have reduced transport costs, boosting trade efficiency. The Standard Gauge Railway and LAPSSET corridor projects have connected Kenya more deeply with its neighbors.</p>
        
          <p>Digital innovation has been a game-changer. Mobile money platforms like M-Pesa continue to dominate, while fintech startups are reshaping access to credit and savings for millions of Kenyans.</p>
        
          <p>Agriculture remains the backbone of the economy, contributing 25% of GDP. Advances in irrigation, climate-smart farming, and agritech startups have helped farmers adapt to unpredictable weather patterns.</p>
        
          <p>The services sector, particularly tourism and hospitality, has rebounded strongly after the pandemic. Coastal towns like Mombasa and Malindi are seeing renewed visitor numbers, while safari tourism remains a global draw.</p>
        
          <p>Kenya’s youth population has been a driving force. With Gen Z entering the workforce, innovation in fintech, agritech, and creative industries has accelerated.</p>
        
          <p>Startups in Nairobi’s “Silicon Savannah” are attracting global investors, positioning Kenya as a hub for African technology. Venture capital inflows have doubled in the past five years.</p>
        
          <p>Regional integration has boosted growth. Kenya’s role in the East African Community (EAC) has opened new trade opportunities, while transport corridors have strengthened connections with Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda.</p>
        
          <p>Exports of tea, coffee, and horticultural products remain strong contributors to foreign exchange earnings. Kenya’s floriculture industry continues to dominate European markets.</p>
        
          <p>Beyond economics, this milestone reflects Kenya’s cultural and social dynamism. The creative sector — film, music, literature, and digital storytelling — is increasingly contributing to GDP while shaping Kenya’s global identity.</p>
        
          <p>Nairobi’s film festivals and Kisumu’s music scene are drawing international attention, reinforcing Kenya’s cultural footprint. Creative industries now contribute 5% to GDP.</p>
        
          <p>Analysts warn that without careful fiscal management, gains could be undermined by global commodity price fluctuations. Rising debt levels remain a concern for policymakers.</p>
        
          <p>Inflationary pressures have tested households, with food and fuel prices fluctuating. The government has responded with subsidies and targeted social programs to cushion vulnerable groups.</p>
        
          <p>Climate change remains a looming challenge. Droughts and floods continue to disrupt agriculture, underscoring the need for sustainable practices and renewable energy adoption.</p>
        
          <p>Kenya’s renewable energy sector is a bright spot. Geothermal, wind, and solar projects have positioned the country as a leader in clean energy across Africa.</p>
        
          <p>Education and skills development are critical for sustaining growth. Universities and technical institutes are expanding programs in STEM, preparing youth for the digital economy.</p>
        
          <p>Policymakers emphasize the need for inclusive growth, ensuring that rural communities and marginalized groups benefit from the economic expansion. Equity remains central to Kenya’s long-term vision.</p>
        
          <p>As Kenya celebrates this milestone, the focus now shifts to balancing ambition with sustainability. The Sh11 trillion GDP mark is not just a statistic — it is a reflection of resilience, creativity, and determination.</p>
        
          <p>Looking ahead, Kenya’s economic journey will depend on innovation, regional cooperation, and sustainable development. The next decade offers both promise and responsibility for Africa’s rising giant.</p>
