    <blockquote>
      “This was a statement win. KCB showed why they remain the benchmark for Kenyan rugby,” said a local commentator.
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>The game began with KCB asserting control early, scoring multiple tries within the first 20 minutes. Their forwards bulldozed through the Leos’ defense, setting the tone for the rest of the encounter.</p>
  
    <p>Leos struggled to find rhythm, often pinned back in their own half. Despite flashes of brilliance, their errors proved costly against a side as clinical as KCB.</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      “Every mistake was punished. KCB’s efficiency is unmatched,” noted a former Kenya Cup player.
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>By halftime, the scoreboard read 40–7, leaving fans in awe of KCB’s precision. The second half only amplified their dominance, with substitutes adding fresh energy and maintaining relentless pressure.</p>
  
    <p>Leos managed two consolation tries, but they were overshadowed by KCB’s relentless scoring. The gulf in class was evident, highlighting the gap between title contenders and mid-table teams.</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      “It wasn’t just about winning; it was about making a statement for the season ahead,” remarked KCB’s captain.
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>The victory strengthens KCB’s position at the top of the Kenya Cup standings, sending a clear warning to rivals. Their blend of youth and experience seems perfectly balanced for another championship run.</p>
