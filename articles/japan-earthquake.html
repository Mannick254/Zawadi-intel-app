        </configuration>
        <p>A powerful earthquake struck northern Japan early Tuesday morning, sending shockwaves through densely populated regions and triggering widespread disruption.</p>
        <p>The tremor, which registered a magnitude above 7.0, caused buildings to collapse, roads to crack, and thousands to evacuate in fear of aftershocks and potential tsunamis.</p>
        <p>Local authorities responded swiftly, deploying emergency services to assess damage and rescue trapped individuals. Hospitals reported a surge in injuries, while several regions experienced power outages and communication breakdowns.</p>
        <p>The Japanese Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings for coastal areas, urging residents to move to higher ground as a precaution.</p>
        <p>The quake’s epicenter was located near a major industrial zone, home to several semiconductor and automotive plants. Initial reports indicate that production lines have halted, raising concerns about ripple effects across global supply chains.</p>
        <p>Scenes from the affected areas show collapsed buildings, overturned vehicles, and rescue teams navigating debris-strewn streets. In one district, a school building pancaked during morning hours, prompting a massive search-and-rescue operation.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida addressed the nation, expressing solidarity with victims and pledging full mobilization of national resources. “We will rebuild stronger,” he said.</p>
        <p>International leaders, including those from the U.S., EU, and neighboring Asian countries, have offered support and aid, emphasizing global solidarity in disaster response.</p>
        <p>The earthquake has reignited discussions about Japan’s vulnerability to seismic activity. Despite strict building codes and advanced warning systems, the scale of destruction highlights the ongoing challenge of disaster mitigation in urban zones.</p>
        <p>Global markets reacted swiftly to the news. Tokyo’s stock exchange saw a sharp dip in technology and automotive shares, while oil prices fluctuated amid concerns over disrupted logistics.</p>
        <p>Humanitarian organizations have begun mobilizing relief efforts. The Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, and local NGOs are coordinating food, shelter, and medical aid.</p>
        <p>In Nairobi and other African capitals, news of the quake sparked solidarity campaigns. Japan’s longstanding partnerships in development and technology have fostered deep ties with African nations.</p>

        <blockquote>President William Ruto (via official communications): “Kenya stands with the people of Japan during this tragic moment. Our prayers are with the victims, and we call for stronger global unity in disaster preparedness.”</blockquote>


        <p>Environmental scientists are monitoring the quake’s impact on coastal ecosystems. Early data suggests possible shifts in seabed topography, which could affect marine biodiversity and fishing zones.</p>
        <p>Social media has played a critical role in shaping public awareness. Hashtags like #JapanQuake and #PrayForJapan have trended globally, with users sharing footage, survivor stories, and calls for aid.</p>
        <p>As rescue operations continue, stories of resilience are emerging. The coming days will be crucial for recovery, rebuilding, and reflection on global preparedness for natural disasters.</p>
