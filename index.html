    💰 Deal Collapses — Ukraine May Receive $140 Billion in Frozen Russian Assets

  <div class="story-content" style="display:none;">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 24, 2025</p>
    <p>A major international deal to redirect frozen Russian assets has collapsed, opening the door for Ukraine to receive <strong>$140 billion</strong> in direct transfers. These funds, frozen across Europe and North America since 2022, were initially earmarked for a joint reconstruction fund.</p>
    <p>Legal hurdles and political pressure derailed negotiations, prompting Western governments to consider bypassing Russia and allocating the assets directly to Kyiv. Ukraine’s finance ministry called the move “a historic moment of justice.”</p>
    <p>Russia condemned the development as “economic warfare” and threatened retaliatory seizures and legal action. Analysts say this marks a shift in the financial front of the war — from containment to active resource reallocation.</p>

  <h2>💣 Gaza–Israel Ceasefire Crumbles</h2>
  <img src="images/gaza.png" alt="Gaza skyline after Israeli airstrike" />
  <p class="byline">By Zawadi Intel Editorial Desk — October 26, 2025</p>

  <p>In a devastating escalation, Israeli airstrikes leveled residential blocks in Khan Younis and Jabalia, killing dozens and reigniting fears of a full-scale ground invasion. The collapse of ceasefire negotiations has plunged Gaza deeper into humanitarian crisis.</p>

  <p>The image above, captured at dawn, shows a father carrying his injured daughter through rubble-strewn streets. Behind them, a collapsed apartment complex smolders as emergency crews search for survivors. The child’s face is streaked with ash, her arm wrapped in a bloodied cloth.</p>

  <p>International mediators have called for an immediate halt to hostilities. President Trump proposed a multinational peacekeeping force, but Israel rejected Turkish participation, citing security concerns. The UN warns of a catastrophe as food, water, and medical supplies dwindle.</p>

  <p>Military analysts say the strikes aim to dismantle Hamas’s tunnel networks and command centers. Israeli officials claim the operation is “surgical,” while Palestinian sources report widespread civilian casualties and infrastructure collapse.</p>

  <p>With over 68,000 dead, Gaza has become a symbol of survival and resistance. Aid workers describe it as “a city of ghosts,” where families sleep in bombed-out schools and children draw tanks in trauma clinics. The war now wages across memory, infrastructure, and identity.</p>

  <h2>🇺🇦 Ukraine Strikes Russian Oil Sites</h2>
  <img src="images/ukraine.png" alt="Ukraine drone strike on Russian refinery" />
  <p class="byline">By Zawadi Intel Editorial Desk — October 22, 2025</p>

  <p>In one of the most daring operations of the war, Ukrainian forces launched a series of drone strikes targeting Russian oil infrastructure deep inside enemy territory. The attack ignited massive fires across multiple refineries, sending plumes of black smoke into the night sky and triggering emergency responses from Russian firefighters.</p>

  <p>The image above, captured moments after the strike, shows two responders battling flames at a refinery near Belgorod. One firefighter, clad in yellow gear marked “АЗДУМА,” directs a jet of water toward a burning storage tank. The other, in black protective gear, grips the hose with grim determination as flames engulf the industrial complex behind them.</p>

  <p>U.S. officials have called for restraint, while former President Trump urged a “freeze on the front lines” to prevent further escalation. NATO surveillance flights have intensified along the eastern corridor, and diplomatic channels remain tense as Moscow vows retaliation.</p>

  <p>Military analysts say the strikes were aimed at crippling Russia’s fuel supply chain ahead of winter. Ukrainian officials have not commented publicly, but sources close to Kyiv suggest the operation was coordinated with Western intelligence.</p>

  <p>As the war enters its third year, the battlefield is no longer confined to trenches and towns — it now includes the economic arteries that fuel conflict. This strike marks a turning point in Ukraine’s strategy: precision, disruption, and psychological warfare.</p>

  <h2>🛰️ Taiwan Strait Maneuvers Intensify</h2>
  <img src="images/taiwan.png" alt="PLA aircraft near Taiwan airspace" />
  <p class="byline">By Zawadi Intel Editorial Desk — October 28, 2025</p>

  <p>In a dramatic escalation, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense reported 229 PLA aircraft crossing the median line in a single week. The surge in military activity has triggered alarms across the Indo-Pacific, with U.S. and Australian forces increasing joint drills in response.</p>

  <p>The image above shows a Taiwanese radar operator tracking multiple inbound aircraft near Hualien. A red alert flashes across the console as silhouettes of J-16 fighters streak across the screen. Outside, air raid sirens echo through coastal towns.</p>

  <p>Australia lodged a formal protest after a Chinese jet fired flares near a surveillance aircraft. Meanwhile, U.S. carrier groups repositioned near Okinawa, and Japan activated emergency protocols for its southern islands.</p>

  <p>Chinese officials claim the maneuvers are “routine,” but analysts say the scale and timing suggest a rehearsal for blockade operations. Taiwan’s President has called for “strategic calm,” while local militias prepare contingency shelters and supply caches.</p>

  <p>As tensions mount, the Strait becomes more than a military corridor — it’s a symbolic battleground for sovereignty, deterrence, and psychological warfare. The skies above Taiwan now carry the weight of history, identity, and global alignment.</p>

  <h2>🔥 Sudan’s Last Stronghold Falls</h2>
  <img src="images/sudan.png" alt="El-Fasher under siege by RSF forces" />
  <p class="byline">By Zawadi Intel Editorial Desk — October 25, 2025</p>

  <p>In a grim milestone for Sudan’s civil war, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have seized El-Fasher, the final Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) stronghold in Darfur. The fall of the city marks a symbolic collapse of state control and deepens fears of ethnic cleansing.</p>

  <p>The image above shows RSF fighters patrolling a scorched street near the city’s central hospital. Smoke rises from a bombed maternity ward as civilians flee with children and bundles of belongings. UN officials warn of “mass atrocities” and demand immediate humanitarian access.</p>

  <p>Over 250,000 civilians remain trapped in El-Fasher, with food and water running out. Hospitals have been bombed, and aid convoys blocked. The UN Security Council held an emergency session, but no resolution was passed. Regional powers remain divided on intervention.</p>

  <p>Military analysts say the RSF’s strategy is to consolidate control over Darfur’s trade routes and mineral zones. The SAF retreat signals a shift toward militia-led governance, with tribal alliances replacing national institutions.</p>

  <p>As Sudan’s war enters its second year, the battlefield now includes identity, survival, and memory. Families bury loved ones in courtyards, children draw tanks in refugee camps, and elders speak of Darfur as “a land swallowed by fire.”</p>

  <img src="images/West bank.png" alt="Olive harvest disrupted by settler attacks" />
  <p class="byline">By Zawadi Intel Editorial Desk — October 22, 2025</p>

  <p>Violence across the West Bank has reached alarming levels, with Israeli settlers attacking Palestinian olive harvesters and the IDF conducting widespread raids. The UN warns of “skyrocketing aggression” as tensions spiral out of control.</p>

  <p>The image above shows an elderly Palestinian woman being carried to safety after settlers hurled stones at her harvesting group near Nablus. Her arm is bandaged, her face pale with shock. Behind her, uprooted olive trees lie scattered across the hillside.</p>

  <p>Israeli forces detained 45 Palestinians in overnight raids, citing security concerns. Human rights groups report home demolitions, curfews, and restricted movement in key villages. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the actions as “collective punishment.”</p>

  <p>Analysts say the violence is tied to land disputes and political fragmentation. Settler groups claim self-defense, while Palestinians describe systematic intimidation. International observers call for de-escalation, but diplomatic efforts remain stalled
