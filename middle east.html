      <h2> Gaza War: Why Israel Bombed Gaza</h2>

         <figcaption><i>Gaza under bomberdment by Israel airstrike</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise cross-border attack, killing over 1,200 Israelis and taking hostages. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Gaza‚Äôs infrastructure, claiming self-defense.</p>
      <p>Critics argue that Israel‚Äôs retaliation was disproportionate, hitting hospitals, schools, and refugee camps. The UN reported over 30,000 Palestinian deaths by late 2025.</p>
      <p>Israel‚Äôs government cited Hamas tunnels and rocket sites embedded in civilian zones as justification. However, human rights groups questioned the legality of such strikes.</p>
      <p>The bombing campaign intensified after ceasefire talks collapsed in January 2025. Israel deployed F-35 jets and Iron Dome upgrades to suppress rocket fire.</p>
      <p>U.S. and EU leaders urged restraint, while Egypt and Qatar attempted mediation. The humanitarian crisis worsened, with over 2 million Gazans displaced.</p>
      <p>As of October 2025, a fragile ceasefire holds, but tensions remain high. Reconstruction efforts are slow, and political reconciliation seems distant.</p>

    <!--  Gaza Genocide Allegations -->
    <article class="conflict-zone">
      <h2>Gaza: Genocide Allegations and Global Response</h2>
      <p>International lawyers and UN rapporteurs have accused Israel of committing acts that may constitute genocide in Gaza. The term gained traction after mass civilian casualties.</p>
      <p>Israel denies the allegations, calling them politically motivated. It argues that Hamas uses civilians as shields, complicating military operations.</p>
      <p>South Africa and Turkey filed motions at the International Criminal Court (ICC), demanding investigations into war crimes and ethnic cleansing.</p>
      <p>Global protests erupted in London, Nairobi, and Jakarta, with demonstrators calling for sanctions and arms embargoes against Israel.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Israeli officials maintain that their actions are lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, citing self-defense against terrorism.</p>
      <p>The ICC has yet to issue formal indictments, but the debate over genocide continues to polarize global opinion and diplomatic alliances.</p>

    <!--  Syria: Civil War and Foreign Influence -->
    <article class="conflict-zone">
      <h2>Syria: Civil War and Foreign Influence</h2>
      <p>Syria‚Äôs civil war, now in its 14th year, remains a complex battleground of regional and global powers. The Assad regime controls most urban centers, while rebel factions hold pockets in Idlib and Aleppo.</p>
      <p>Russia continues to support Assad with airstrikes and military advisors. Iran backs Hezbollah units operating in southern Syria, while Turkey supports opposition militias near its border.</p>
      <p>U.S. forces maintain a presence in northeastern Syria, supporting Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) against ISIS remnants. Tensions with Assad‚Äôs forces have led to sporadic clashes.</p>
      <p>Humanitarian conditions are dire. Over 12 million Syrians remain displaced, and cholera outbreaks have hit refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Peace talks in Geneva have stalled, with no consensus on Assad‚Äôs future. The UN calls for renewed diplomacy, but regional rivalries hinder progress.</p>
      <p>As of October 2025, Syria remains a fractured state, with foreign influence shaping its future more than domestic governance.</p>

    <!-- üáØüá¥ Jordan: Border Tensions and Refugee Pressure -->
    <article class="conflict-zone">
      <h2>üáØüá¥ Jordan: Border Tensions and Refugee Pressure</h2>
      <p>Jordan faces mounting pressure from Syrian and Palestinian refugees, straining its economy and social services. Over 3 million displaced people now reside in camps and urban centers.</p>
      <p>Border clashes with Syrian militias have increased, prompting Amman to deploy additional troops and surveillance drones.</p>
      <p>King Abdullah II has urged international donors to increase aid, warning that Jordan‚Äôs stability is at risk.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, domestic protests over fuel prices and unemployment have challenged the monarchy‚Äôs grip.</p>
      <p>Jordan remains a key U.S. ally and mediator in Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian negotiations, but its internal challenges are growing.</p>
      <p>As of October 2025, Jordan walks a tightrope between regional diplomacy and domestic unrest.</p>

    <!-- Iran: Nuclear Tensions and Proxy Wars -->
    <article class="conflict-zone">
      <h2>üáÆüá∑ Iran: Nuclear Tensions and Proxy Wars</h2>
      <p>Iran‚Äôs uranium enrichment program has reached 90% purity, sparking alarm in Washington and Tel Aviv. Talks in Vienna collapsed after Iran demanded sanctions relief.</p>
      <p>Israel has threatened preemptive strikes, while the U.S. deployed carrier groups to the Gulf. Tehran insists its program is peaceful.</p>
      <p>Iran continues to support proxy groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. These militias have clashed with U.S. and Israeli forces repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Domestic protests over inflation and repression have rocked Tehran, with women-led movements gaining traction despite crackdowns.</p>
      <p>Ayatollah Khamenei remains defiant, blaming foreign interference for unrest. The Revolutionary Guard has tightened control over dissent.</p>
      <p>As of October 2025, Iran stands at a crossroads ‚Äî balancing nuclear ambition, regional influence, and internal dissent.</p>

      <p>Economic collapse continues, with the Lebanese pound losing 95% of its value. Banks remain closed, and fuel shortages persist.</p>
