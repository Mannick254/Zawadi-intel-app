Zawadi minimal server

This small server provides two endpoints used by the site for tracking login counts:

- POST /api/login  -- body: { username, ts }
- GET  /api/stats  -- returns total and recent logins

How to run:

1. Open a terminal in this folder and run:

   npm install
   npm start

2. The server will listen on port 3001 by default. To change the port, set PORT environment variable.

If you run the server from the project root, it will also serve the static site so you can visit http://localhost:3001/admin.html
