            <!-- Section 1: Ethnic Succession Debate -->
            <h3>⚖️ Ethnic Succession Debate</h3>
            <p>Fredrick Odilo has positioned himself as a key voice in Busia’s succession politics, proposing an Iteso–Luhya pact to balance power in the county.</p>
            <p>His rhetoric has stirred conversations in villages and town halls, where communities debate whether ethnic agreements strengthen or weaken democracy.</p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtcb3ffnv/image/upload/v1768287633/WhatsApp_Image_2026-01-13_at_9.53.10_AM_oovdel.jpg" alt="Odilo addressing supporters" class="article-image" />
            <p class="caption">Odilo addressing supporters in Butula during a succession rally.</p>
            <p>By invoking ethnic solidarity, Odilo hopes to consolidate votes from both blocs, presenting himself as a bridge-builder.</p>
            <p>Critics argue that such rhetoric risks polarizing Busia, but Odilo insists it is about fairness and representation.</p>
            <p>At community gatherings, elders recall past elections where ethnic unity determined outcomes, suggesting Odilo’s strategy taps into historical memory.</p>
            <p>Youth groups, however, express skepticism, arguing that issue-based politics should replace ethnic bargaining in modern campaigns.</p>

            <p>Odilo frames his proposal as a safeguard against marginalization, claiming that without such agreements, one community risks perpetual exclusion.</p>
            <p>His speeches often highlight the need for inclusivity, portraying himself as the guarantor of balanced leadership in Busia.</p>
            <p>Opponents counter that Odilo’s pact undermines meritocracy, warning that it could entrench tribalism rather than foster unity.</p>
            <p>Despite criticism, Odilo’s rallies attract large crowds, signaling that his message resonates with voters who feel overlooked by mainstream politics.</p>
            <p>Political analysts note that the debate has forced other aspirants to clarify their positions, reshaping the campaign narrative around ethnicity versus issues.</p>

            <!-- Section 2: Feud with Governor Otuoma -->
            <h3>🔥 Feud with Governor Otuoma</h3>
            <p>Odilo’s rivalry with Governor Paul Otuoma has become the centerpiece of Busia’s campaign drama.</p>
            <p>He accuses Otuoma of sidelining the Assembly, while Otuoma’s allies portray Odilo as obstructionist.</p>

            <figcaption>Odilo and Governor Otuoma during a tense Assembly session.</figcaption>
            <p>At rallies, Odilo frames himself as the defender of accountability, promising to restore checks and balances.</p>
            <p>His speeches often highlight alleged failures in service delivery, resonating with frustrated residents.</p>

            <p>Odilo frequently points to stalled infrastructure projects, arguing that Otuoma’s administration has failed to deliver on promises made during the last election cycle.</p>
            <p>In Butula, he reminded residents of uncompleted road projects, using them as evidence of mismanagement under Otuoma’s leadership.</p>

            <figcaption>Residents gather near an unfinished road project, a recurring theme in Odilo’s campaign speeches.</figcaption>
            <p>Governor Otuoma’s camp counters by accusing Odilo of politicizing development, claiming that delays are due to budget constraints rather than negligence.</p>
            <p>Odilo’s supporters, however, argue that the Speaker is exposing corruption and inefficiency, positioning him as a reformist candidate.</p>

            <p>During a rally in Nambale, Odilo declared that “Busia deserves leaders who listen to the people, not those who silence the Assembly.” His words drew loud applause from the crowd.</p>
            <p>Otuoma’s allies responded by organizing counter-rallies, painting Odilo as divisive and self-serving, further intensifying the political rivalry.</p>

            <p>Analysts note that the feud has become symbolic of broader governance struggles in Busia, with voters forced to choose between continuity and reform.</p>
            <p>Odilo’s campaign tactics often include direct engagement with grassroots communities, contrasting with Otuoma’s reliance on established political networks.</p>

            <p>In church gatherings, Odilo emphasizes moral leadership, accusing Otuoma of betraying public trust. This religious framing resonates strongly with faith-based groups.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Otuoma’s administration highlights ongoing healthcare and education projects, attempting to shift focus away from the feud and toward tangible achievements.</p>

            <p>As the 2027 elections approach, the Odilo–Otuoma feud is expected to dominate campaign narratives, shaping voter perceptions and alliances across the county.</p>

             <!-- Section 3: Corruption Allegations -->
<h3>🚨 Corruption Allegations</h3>
<p>Odilo faces investigations by the EACC over alleged tender irregularities tied to an e-parliament system.</p>
<p>Opponents use these allegations to question his credibility, but Odilo counters by calling them politically motivated.</p>

<p>Supporters rally behind him, arguing that investigations are part of a smear campaign orchestrated by rivals.</p>

<p>Odilo insists that the procurement process was lawful, claiming that all tenders were vetted by the Assembly’s finance committee.</p>
<p>He has challenged investigators to make their findings public, arguing that secrecy fuels speculation and damages his reputation.</p>

<p>Governor Otuoma’s allies seize on the allegations, warning voters that electing Odilo could compromise Busia’s integrity.</p>

<p>Such pledges resonate with voters frustrated by opaque governance, strengthening his image as a transparency champion despite the allegations.</p>

<p>These pledges have earned him growing support among grassroots women’s groups, who see him as attentive to their daily struggles.</p>

<p>His campaign style is highly personal, often walking through villages and engaging residents in open dialogue rather than relying solely on rallies.</p>
<p>Analysts note that this hands-on approach distinguishes him from rivals who depend more on elite endorsements and large-scale events.</p>

<p>Odilo’s corruption allegations, though local, have national resonance, as they feed into broader debates about integrity in Kenyan leadership.</p>
<p>Opponents argue that elevating Odilo nationally could undermine reform agendas, while supporters see him as a symbol of resilience against political witch-hunts.</p>

<p>International observers also monitor Busia’s politics, noting that Odilo’s rise could influence Kenya’s image as a democracy capable of resolving disputes through dialogue.</p>
<p>Diplomatic missions have quietly acknowledged Busia’s importance, given its border location and role in regional trade, making Odilo’s leadership style nationally significant.</p>
