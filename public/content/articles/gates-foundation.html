    <p>The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has issued a stark warning: the world risks reversing decades of progress in global health, with child mortality rates projected to rise for the first time since the mid-20th century.</p>
    <p>A new report from the foundation estimates that if current trends of declining international aid persist, an additional 4.8 million children under five could die over the next decade.</p>
    <p>This projection comes amid widespread cuts to foreign aid budgets by major donor nations, citing domestic economic pressures and shifting political priorities.</p>
    <p>The report argues that these decisions will have catastrophic consequences for vulnerable populations and global stability.</p>
    <p>"We are at a precipice," said Melinda French Gates. "To see progress stall and reverse is a moral failure."</p>
    <p>She emphasized that these are not just statistics—they represent real children with families and futures.</p>
    <p>Immunization programs, which have helped control diseases like measles and polio, are among the most threatened by funding cuts.</p>
    <p>Millions of children could be left unprotected, increasing the risk of outbreaks and preventable deaths.</p>
    <p>Nutrition programs are also at risk, potentially worsening stunting and cognitive impairment in early childhood.</p>
    <p>Maternal and newborn health services face similar threats, with fewer skilled birth attendants and reduced access to emergency care.</p>
    <p>Essential medicines and supplies may become scarce, leading to higher maternal mortality and neonatal deaths.</p>
    <p>The Gates Foundation is urging world leaders to recommit to global health goals and honor their aid pledges.</p>
    <p>Investing in health is not just charitable—it promotes economic development and global security.</p>
    <p>"A world where millions of children die from preventable causes is not a secure world," said Bill Gates.</p>
    <p>He stressed that the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of intervention.</p>
    <p>The report calls for innovative financing strategies, including domestic resource mobilization in developing countries.</p>
    <p>It encourages governments to increase their own health budgets and prioritize high-impact interventions.</p>
    <p>Strategic use of development assistance can maximize outcomes even with limited resources.</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of global health systems and the urgency of preparedness.</p>
    <p>It also highlighted the interconnectedness of health, economics, and geopolitics.</p>
    <p>The Gates Foundation warns that neglecting global health now will deepen inequality and prolong recovery.</p>
    <p>It calls for renewed global solidarity and a shared commitment to health equity.</p>
    <p>Technology and innovation must be harnessed to improve access and efficiency in healthcare delivery.</p>
    <p>Digital health tools, telemedicine, and mobile diagnostics offer scalable solutions for underserved regions.</p>
    <p>Community-based programs and local leadership are essential for sustainable impact.</p>
    <p>Philanthropic organizations and private sector partners must continue to support health initiatives.</p>
    <p>Public awareness and advocacy are key to maintaining political will and accountability.</p>
    <p>The report concludes with a powerful message: the fate of millions of children depends on decisions made today.</p>
    <p>Global health is not a distant issue—it is a shared responsibility that defines our humanity.</p>
