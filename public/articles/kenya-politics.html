          <p>Senior ODM politician Oburu Oginga has called on President William Ruto to fully implement the 10-point agreement reached with Raila Odinga, warning that failure to do so could destabilize Kenya’s political landscape ahead of the 2027 elections.</p>
          <p>Speaking at a rally in Kisumu, Oburu emphasized that the deal was not just a handshake but a roadmap for national unity. He urged the government to prioritize electoral reforms, youth empowerment, and equitable resource distribution as outlined in the pact.</p>
          <p>“This agreement was meant to heal divisions and build trust. If it is ignored, Kenyans will feel betrayed,” Oburu said, drawing applause from the crowd. His remarks reignited debate over whether the Ruto administration is committed to bipartisan cooperation.</p>
          <p>Political analysts note that the Raila–Ruto deal was historic, bridging rival camps after years of tension. However, implementation has been slow, with critics accusing the government of cherry-picking provisions while sidelining key reforms.</p>
          <p>Supporters of Raila argue that honoring the deal would strengthen democracy and reduce election-related violence. They point to past cycles where contested polls led to unrest, insisting that reforms are essential for stability.</p>
          <p>Opposition leaders have also warned that ignoring the agreement could fuel mistrust among youth, who already feel excluded from political processes. Many young Kenyans see the pact as a chance to secure fair representation and opportunities.</p>
          <p>Government officials, however, maintain that progress is being made. They cite ongoing electoral reforms and youth programs, though critics argue these efforts fall short of the original commitments.</p>
          <p>“We cannot afford another cycle of broken promises. The Raila deal is a test of political maturity,” said one civil society leader, urging transparency in the process.</p>
          <p>Observers believe that honoring the agreement could also improve Kenya’s international standing, showing that the country can resolve political disputes through dialogue rather than confrontation.</p>
          <p>As the 2027 elections draw closer, the fate of the Raila–Ruto deal remains uncertain. For many Kenyans, it symbolizes hope for unity, but its success depends on whether promises translate into action.</p>
