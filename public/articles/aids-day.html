        <div class="article-body">
          <p>As Kenya joins the world in commemorating World AIDS Day, the nation takes a moment to reflect on its journey in the fight against HIV/AIDS. This year's theme, "Let Communities Lead," underscores the critical role of community involvement in achieving the ambitious goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. While Kenya has made significant strides, a closer look reveals a complex reality, especially for the nation's youth, where the gap between government targets and lived experiences remains a pressing concern.</p>

          <h2>The 95-95-95 Targets</h2>
          <p>At the heart of Kenya's national HIV response are the ambitious UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. These goals aim to ensure that 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% of those diagnosed receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95% of those on treatment achieve viral suppression. While progress is palpable, national averages mask deep disparities, with young people lagging behind.</p>

          <h2>Stigma and Youth</h2>
          <p>The reality for many young Kenyans is a daily struggle against a virus that is as much a social challenge as it is a medical one. Stigma remains one of the most formidable barriers, discouraging young people from getting tested, disclosing their status, and adhering to treatment. This pervasive fear creates a silent epidemic of fear and misinformation.</p>

          <h2>Healthcare Access Gaps</h2>
          <p>The challenge of stigma is compounded by uneven access to healthcare. While major urban centers boast well-equipped HIV clinics, the situation in many rural and marginalized communities is vastly different. These barriers to access disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, creating a cycle of poverty and poor health.</p>

          <h2>A Story of Resilience</h2>
          <p>Despite these daunting challenges, Kenya's story is also one of remarkable resilience and progress. The scale-up of ART has been a monumental achievement, transforming an HIV diagnosis from a death sentence into a manageable chronic condition. The prevention of mother-to-child transmission program has been particularly successful, with transmission rates plummeting in recent years.</p>
