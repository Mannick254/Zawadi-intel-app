    <!-- Expanded Article Body -->
    <section class="article-body">
      <p>France and other nations are rearming with new military service programs and multi‑billion defense plans. The resurgence of conscription reflects growing concerns over regional stability and the future of Europe’s security architecture.</p>
      <p>In Paris, officials announced a phased reintroduction of mandatory service, citing the need to bolster readiness against hybrid threats and cyber warfare. The move has sparked debate across the continent.</p>
      <p>Germany, long hesitant to revive conscription, is now considering similar measures. Policymakers argue that voluntary recruitment alone may not meet the demands of an increasingly uncertain security environment.</p>
      <p>Eastern European states, already on high alert due to tensions along their borders, have welcomed the idea of broader European solidarity in defense. For them, conscription is seen as a deterrent as much as a necessity.</p>
      <p>Critics, however, warn that mandatory service could strain resources and divert attention from professional modernization. They argue that conscription risks producing undertrained forces rather than highly specialized units.</p>
      <p>Supporters counter that national service fosters civic duty, resilience, and unity. They highlight the social benefits of shared training experiences across diverse communities.</p>
      <p>European unity in defense spending aims to strengthen NATO’s collective capabilities. Joint exercises and pooled resources are being emphasized as part of a broader strategy to deter aggression.</p>
      <p>France’s defense ministry has outlined plans for expanded training facilities, new equipment procurement, and partnerships with private industry to support the influx of recruits.</p>
      <p>In Brussels, EU leaders are discussing how conscription policies might align with broader European defense initiatives. Coordination is seen as vital to avoid duplication and inefficiency.</p>
      <p>Military analysts note that the revival of conscription is not just about numbers. It signals a cultural shift toward preparedness and a recognition that peace cannot be taken for granted.</p>
      <p>Public opinion remains divided. Some citizens welcome the chance to serve, while others fear disruption to education and careers. Governments are exploring flexible models to balance obligations with personal development.</p>
      <p>Technology is also shaping the debate. Modern conscription programs are expected to include cyber defense, drone operations, and digital intelligence alongside traditional infantry training.</p>
      <p>Economic implications are significant. Defense budgets are rising, and industries tied to military production anticipate growth. Yet questions remain about sustainability in times of economic strain.</p>
      <p>Universities and employers are being consulted on how to integrate conscription periods without derailing academic and professional pathways. Pilot programs are testing short‑term service models.</p>
      <p>Diplomatically, the revival of conscription sends a message to allies and adversaries alike. It underscores Europe’s determination to shoulder more responsibility for its own defense.</p>
      <p>Neighboring countries outside the EU are watching closely. Some see opportunities for cooperation, while others worry about escalation and arms races.</p>
      <p>Human rights groups have raised concerns about fairness and exemptions. They call for transparent policies to ensure that conscription does not disproportionately affect marginalized communities.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, veterans’ organizations have welcomed the move, noting that national service can instill discipline and provide valuable skills for civilian life.</p>
      <p>As security challenges evolve, these measures may redefine Europe’s approach to military preparedness. The balance between professional armies and citizen soldiers is being recalibrated.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the revival of conscription reflects a continent grappling with uncertainty. It is both a practical response to immediate threats and a symbolic gesture of resilience.</p>
      <p>Whether these policies succeed will depend on careful implementation, public support, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing geopolitical realities.</p>
